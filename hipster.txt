Because focaccia has so few components, the ingredients you use should be of utmost quality. Use vegetables in season and the highest quality olive oil you can find. In this post, I worked with Jovial’s Olio Nuovo, a fresh-pressed olive oil from the Valpantena area of Northern Italy. It’s rather difficult to source exclusively fresh-pressed olive oil. Usually, this oil is blended with aged oil, balancing the flavor profile to make it consistent with other offerings throughout the year. This fresh oil has a delicate flavor but a balanced, upfront fruitiness as well. If you’ve never had the chance to try an oil like this you’ll be pleasantly surprised.

With this naturally leavened focaccia I wanted little sourness in the result. While I typically include  whole grains in most of my recipes, I wanted the flavor of this classic bread to be mild, to allow the taste of the olive oil and toppings to come forward. Removing all the whole grain flour from initial trials hit the spot.

For this formula, I blended 30% high protein flour (about 13% protein) with 70% all-purpose flour (11-12% protein). The high protein flour helps give this highly-hydrated dough strength and structure — and 30% is just enough.
