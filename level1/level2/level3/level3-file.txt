Special Equipment

For this sourdough focaccia you will need a round or rectangular pan for baking. I like to use a deep pan (as opposed to a baking sheet) so the focaccia doesn’t dry out too fast in the oven. My preferred pan:

    9″ x 13″ USA Pan Rectangular Cake Pan

This pan has a silicone lined interior, which makes it nonstick, but it also conducts heat extremely well and imparts a wonderful crust on the naturally leavened focaccia.
