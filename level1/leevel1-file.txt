With this naturally leavened focaccia I wanted little sourness in the result. While I typically include  whole grains in most of my recipes, I wanted the flavor of this classic bread to be mild, to allow the taste of the olive oil and toppings to come forward. Removing all the whole grain flour from initial trials hit the spot.

For this formula, I blended 30% high protein flour (about 13% protein) with 70% all-purpose flour (11-12% protein). The high protein flour helps give this highly-hydrated dough strength and structure â€” and 30% is just enough.
